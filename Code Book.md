## Output Columns
The output contains 68 columns overall. 
 - 1st column is the "subject" number, which identifies the subject to which the following data corresponds
 - 2nd column is the "activity", which describes the activity name for which the data was taken
 - 3rd to 68th columns represent the average values of the mean and std-deviation features mentioned in the "features.txt" file. The average is calculated for each subject and activity.
